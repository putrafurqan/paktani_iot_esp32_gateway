I have experience working with a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, Django, and JavaScript for frontend development, along with tRPC API, Prisma, and SQL for backend development. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for cloud services, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and SSL protocols for secure communication.

During my time as a Frontend Developer at WISOKTO ITB, I built a dynamic webpage for 1,000+ graduates, ensuring smooth performance for over 100 concurrent users by optimizing the design with HTML, CSS, and Django. Later, as a Backend Developer at OSKM ITB, I developed and optimized tRPC API endpoints to manage data for over 5,000 users, using Prisma to implement efficient queries. I then applied my cloud skills by deploying an MQTT broker server for Pak Tani IoT on Google Cloud Platform, securing it with SSL protocols and automating infrastructure with Terraform. These experiences have equipped me to deliver both high-quality web solutions and scalable cloud-based services.
